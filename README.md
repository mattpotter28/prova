# Prova

**Prova** is a platform to securely upload and share media files with guarantees that they are **not AI-generated** and **cannot be used for training AI models**. It enables users and third parties (e.g., immigration offices, legal entities) to verify the authenticity of media through cryptographic hashing and digital certificates.

## ‚ú® Project Overview

In the era of generative AI, the ability to prove that a photo, video, or audio is authentic and not AI-created is increasingly important. Prova empowers creators and consumers by:

- Accepting media uploads with hashing and metadata extraction
- Generating a cryptographic proof of authenticity
- Providing public verification URLs for trusted third parties
- Applying anti-AI protections to prevent unauthorized AI training use

---

## üöÄ Features

- Upload media files via a clean, responsive React UI  
- Automatically hash uploaded files (SHA-256)  
- Extract and display media metadata (EXIF, duration, format)  
- Issue verifiable certificates linked to media  
- Dynamic verification pages at `/file/[id]`  
- API endpoints for upload, verification, and protection workflows  
- Designed for integration with AI detection services (Glaze, Nightshade, etc.)  
- Serverless deployment ready via Vercel

## üîß Tech Stack

- **Next.js (App Router) + React + TypeScript**  
- **Vercel** for serverless deployment and hosting  
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling  
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL + Storage) for database and file metadata  
- Crypto libraries for hashing  
- Placeholder hooks for AI detection integration
